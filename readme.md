## Code structure
The code has been divided into three different modules.

### Chembl mining Module
It contains 4 classes that given a target select a set of ligands that bind and ligands that do not bind(20% 80%), generate and store the .pdbqt files of these ligands in a specified data folder

### Descriptors Module
From a series of files .pdbqt of some ligands, stores in an narray the descriptors of these next to a second narray that stores if each ligand does binding or not.

### CNN Module
This module is responsible for generating the CNN, and train it with the data generated by the Descriptors module.


## Execution
To begin, you must configure the configuration file, indicating the parameters you want.
Once the configuration file is completed, the entire project is executed simply by running main.py inside / src:

`python /binding-prediction-DL/src/main.py`

Python 3.5 required
